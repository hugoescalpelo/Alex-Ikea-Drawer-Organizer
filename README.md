# Alex-Ikea-Drawer-Organizer
This repo contains the files of my process and development of Alex Ikea Drawer Organizer

This project is inspired in [Scott Yu-Jan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s74phtezf4).

## Story

I sarted by measuring the drawer, it turns out its dimetions are 52.3cm X 29.2cm X 8.6cm. As reference, I will be using a depth of 6cm because the lid has a height of 6.5cm, so I led 0.5cm as space to open the drawer.

### Step by Step

Since I'm not designing the whole organizer, I decided to start section by section as it can be seen in the following image:

Also, as a personal challenge, I'm trying to make a video about the developement, so I'm recording everything. I hope soon the videos are available to see here.

### Modulartity

I'm plannig to make this drawer organizers available at Thingiverse and printables, so every module will have a name and a function.

## Library

I used the following models:
